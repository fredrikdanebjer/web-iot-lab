## Web IoT Lab

Draft version supporting:

* Accelerometer
* Thermometer
* Button
* RGB LED

**[Try it out here!](https://larsgk.github.io/web-iot-lab/)**

## Prerequisites

* Command line version of `git`
* A recent version of `node` and `npm` (consider using `https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm`)

## Getting started

Clone the repo to a folder, where you keep similar projects, e.g:

```
cd MyWork

git clone https://github.com/larsgk/web-iot-lab.git
```

Even though there is no build process, you will need a small local web server to host the project while working on it.
If you don't have one already, run `npm install` to get a simple http-server as dev dependency.


## Components

`demo-3dobj` - A simple 3D object that can be translated and rotated in 3D

`info-box` - A box displaying a set list of properties and their (updated) values.
